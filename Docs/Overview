Key Components and Their Roles:
User Interface (UI):

The frontend application (e.g., your Netlify app) where users interact with the system.
Provides forms for inputting baseline data (managed by a conceptual "Data Input Agent" often tightly coupled with UI).
Displays intermediate progress and the final business value deliverables (reports, dashboards, narratives).
Communicates with the Orchestration Layer via APIs (e.g., REST or gRPC).
Orchestration Layer (Main Orchestrator Agent):

The "brain" that manages the end-to-end workflow.
Interprets the workflow_definition from its YAML file.
Triggers individual Agent Services in the correct sequence based on dependencies and triggers.
Monitors agent execution status and handles basic retries or error escalation.
Communicates with the UI to update progress and gather further inputs.
Coordinates data flow by telling agents to write to, and read from, the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
Model Context Protocol (MCP) / Knowledge Base:

This is the centralized, canonical data store for all information related to a specific value model instance.
Not a single database, but a protocol or shared abstraction layer that could leverage:
Vector Database: For persona profiles, industry benchmarks, knowledge for RAG.

Graph Database: For complex relationships between value drivers, use cases, and products.
Key-Value Store/Document Store: For storing inputs, intermediate calculation results, and final outputs from agents.
All agents read their required inputs from the MCP and write their outputs back to it, ensuring a single source of truth. This is how data is seamlessly passed between agents.
Individual Agent Services (Containerized Microservices):

Each agent (e.g., Intake Assistant, Use Case Mapper, ROI Calculator, Narrative Generator, Collaboration Coordinator) is deployed as a distinct, containerized microservice (e.g., using Docker and Kubernetes).
This allows for independent development, deployment, scaling, and technology choices for each agent.
They perform their specific tasks as defined in their respective YAML configurations (Initial Prompt, Output Format, Rules).
They interact with the MCP to get inputs and store results.
External Data Sources/Integrations:

Systems like CRM, ERP, financial databases, or public industry benchmark APIs that provide raw data for baseline definitions.
Data might be ingested into the MCP directly or via specialized data connector agents.
Cross-Cutting Concerns:
These are not individual agents but essential system-level functionalities:

Security & Access Control (RBAC):
A robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system dictates who can access the UI, trigger specific agents, or view sensitive outputs.


Permissions are granular, often defined at the agent level (e.g., "Admins Only" for ROI Calculator Agent).


Monitoring & Alerting:
Real-time visibility into agent performance, execution times , costs , and success rates.

Automated alerts for errors or performance degradation.
Logging & Auditing:
Comprehensive logging of all agent activities, inputs, outputs, and decisions for debugging, compliance (Audit Required: Yes/No), and transparency.
Ensuring data retention policies are met.
This architecture provides the flexibility and power to build a highly sophisticated and scalable AI-powered business value modeling platform.
