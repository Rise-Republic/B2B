Sprint 1: Foundational Backend & Core Intelligence
1. Implement Real-Time Semantic Search
Action:
Ensure sentence-transformers is installed and integrated in your semantic memory code (replace random vector fallback).
Validate with unit/integration tests that semantic search returns relevant results.
Stack Guidance:
Your backend already has a semantic memory tier—just plug in the real embedding model.
2. Develop Production-Grade Storage Backends
Action:
Implement async PostgreSQL connector (e.g., using SQLAlchemy/asyncpg).
Integrate a vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, or pgvector) for semantic memory.
Scaffold config for backend switching.
Stack Guidance:
Your pluggable backend design allows this—extend the 
StorageBackend
 interface.
3. Activate Core Data Agents
Action:
Implement a Data Integration Agent (connects to CRM/ERP via API or database).
Implement a Database Connector Agent (manages connections, pooling, failover).
Stack Guidance:
Use FastAPI background tasks or Celery for async data pulls.
4. Enhance Test Coverage
Action:
Write tests for all CRUD/search operations in new backends and agents.
Add integration tests for semantic search and data ingestion.
Sprint 2: Core Agent Ecosystem & UI
1. Finalize Agents
Action:
Review and productionize Intake Assistant, ROI Calculator, Narrative Generator, Business Case Composer.
2. Build Core UI Components
Action:
Implement React components: ROI dashboard, Value pillar dashboard, Business case preview.
Connect UI to backend endpoints.
3. Implement Critical UX Agents
Action:
Progress Tracking Agent (with progress bar UI).
Confidence Scoring Agent (display scores in UI).
Sprint 3: Enterprise Readiness & Advanced Integrations
1. Implement Security & Compliance Agents
Action:
Data Auditing Agent (log all data ops, expose audit logs).
MCP Protocol Compliance Agent (validate agent/data flows).
2. Collaboration & Governance
Action:
Collaboration Coordinator Agent (multi-user, notifications).
RBAC: Enforce role-based access at API and memory/agent level.
3. Monitoring & Alerting
Action:
Health Monitoring Agent (track uptime, errors, performance).
Connect to dashboards (Grafana, ELK, etc.).
Sprint 4: Advanced Analytics & Market Intelligence
1. Integrate External Market Data
Action:
Benchmark Agent (industry/peer data).
Market Trend Agent (real-time market feeds).
2. What-If Scenario Modeling
Action:
Sensitivity Analysis Agent (model assumptions, UI dashboard).
3. Reporting & Analytics
Action:
Analytics Aggregator Agent (central dashboard for metrics).
Sprint 5: Final Polish, Documentation & Launch
1. End-to-End Testing
Action:
Performance, security, and UAT across all workflows.
2. Finalize Documentation
Action:
Update README, user guides, API docs.
3. UI/UX Refinement
Action:
Polish based on UAT feedback.
4. Launch
Action:
Deploy to production (cloud, Docker, etc.).
